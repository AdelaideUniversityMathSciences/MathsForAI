# Week 5

Why is nothing ever really certain?

In this section I will assume you have done several subjects on
probability and statistics, so this is a gloss to help you translate
what you know into a new context. 

### Topics

1. Probability spaces
2. Challenging Data
   1. Noise and denoising
   2. Fast Data and Randomised algorithms
      1. Hashes and fast data and sketches
      2. Fast and Wide: Compressive sensing (part 1) and embeddings
