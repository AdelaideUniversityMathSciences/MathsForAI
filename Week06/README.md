We might play around with the dropout_example.ipynb in the Code directory of this repo.

### Papers
2 papers on dropout in this directory. The single linear activation example in the NeurIPS paper is particularly helpful to illustrate why dropout works.

Most of the examples etc otherwise are from Prince (2023) [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/
