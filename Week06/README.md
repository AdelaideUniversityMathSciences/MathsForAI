# Week 8

### Topics

1. BatchNorm (a teeny tiny bit)
2. Regularisation recap
3. Bias-variance
4. Regularisation in DL
5. Maths of dropout

We'll play around with the dropout_example.ipynb in the Code directory of this repo.

### Papers
2 papers on dropout in this directory. The single linear activation example in the NeurIPS paper is particularly helpful to illustrate why dropout works.
