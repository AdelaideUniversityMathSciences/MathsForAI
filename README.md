# MathsForAI
Mathematics for Artifical Intelligence

This repo is primarily for code (mostly PyTorch Jupyter worksheets) and weekly slides + readings related to the University of Adelaide course Mathematics for AI.

**Note**: This repo contains materials from the 2022 version of the course, and will be updated on a weekly basis as we progress through the course. 
Therefore, directories and codes corresponding to later weeks of the course will not necessarily be accurate to what the final version will be, and you will need to keep checking back each week to get the most up-to-date material for the 2023 version of the course. 
You should only look at the directory and associated notes, slides, codes etc, corresponding to the current week ofthe course!
